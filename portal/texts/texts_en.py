            As it is known, the pulsejet engine was widely used during World War II. In 1943, thanks to the efforts
            of the German engineer Paul Schmidt and the Argus Company, the classic valve pulsejet engine Argus-014 with a
            thrust of 3000 N was created and launched into mass production as a cruise engine for the Fieseler-103 cruise
            missile (V-1). The simplicity and low cost of this engine, as well as the missile itself, allowed tens of
            thousands of units to be produced and made this complex one of the most effective types of weapons created in
            Germany.

            The success of the combat use of the V-1 cruise missiles determined the significant interest of the allies in this
            type of weapon. After World War II, considerable efforts were directed at reproducing the V-1 complex, and then at
            improving cruise missiles with a pulsejet engine, mainly in the USA and the USSR. The work in the USSR came to
            practically nothing, and although quite interesting improved models were created, the results of this work
            perished in the fog of traditional Soviet secrecy. On the contrary, in the USA, serial models were created, which
            remained in service with the Navy for quite a long time, and were then used as air targets. Later, a significant
            number of research works on this engine were declassified and are now freely available. These are fundamental
            works on the subject of pulsejets, they can be downloaded from our website on the "Library" page.

            It is characteristic that during the performance of all this work, not only the advantages of the pulsejet engine
            were noted - extreme simplicity and cheapness due to the absence of rotating and reciprocating parts, but also
            serious disadvantages. In particular, the pulsejet engine is characterized by excessive noise, which gives away
            the aircraft, and significant vibrations transmitted from the engine to the aircraft structure. In addition,
            extremely high wall temperatures are noted, which prevent the engine from being placed inside the aircraft
            fuselage, significant fuel consumption, which limits the range and duration of the flight, as well as a limited
            service life of the intake valves due to the complex impact and temperature effects.

            Due to the above features and disadvantages, the pulsejet engine turned out to be in demand for solving a very
            limited range of problems, in particular, only for attack UAVs or missils of relatively short range (up to several
            hundred kilometers) and for air targets. And it was these disadvantages that turned out to be a virtually
            insurmountable obstacle to the further development and distribution of pulsejets in aviation.

            However, all these disadvantages turned out to be insignificant for aircraft modeling. Therefore, starting in the
            50s of the last century, enthusiasts of aircraft modeling technology created a large number of different designs
            of pulsejets for aircraft modeling. At the same time, given the fact that the valve mechanism is a weak point of
            the classic valved-type pulsejet engine; a large number of works were also aimed at creating designs of a
            valveless pulsejets.

            Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, all these efforts were not crowned with noticeable success, although
            some more or less successful examples of small-scale designs of valveless pulsejets are known. In general, it can
            be noted that interest in the pulsejet engine has arisen periodically over the past 80 years, in waves, which led
            to a revival and then a fading of interest in it. At the same time, today some signs indicate that the topic of
            pulsejets has not been forgotten, and we are again now on a certain rise, although perhaps not too long, as in

            calculating the parameters and altitude-speed characteristics. And here we immediately encounter a new problem -
            for the same 80 years, no theoretical models and programs for calculating a pulsejet engine suitable for practical
            use have been created. That is, some models were developed, and even in large quantities, but not so much for

No problem, you can also easily find a program for modeling ICE and watch practically “live” how the length of the exhaust pipe affects the power.

But as soon as you calculate something, even more questions arise. For example, if the pipe is made a little longer, is it good or bad? And if it is shorter, how will it work? And if the pipe is made conical, is it better or worse? And if we put our pipe on an aircraft and launch it at a speed of about 500-600 kilometers per hour, will it give more or less thrust?

Moreover, none of the created models are operational due to the lack of ready-made programs, excessive complexity and/or cost, the impossibility of acquiring or for some other reason that prevents its widespread use by an ordinary user.

At the same time, the gas flow in the pipes adjacent to the cylinder is considered as 1-dimensional, but taking into account the shape (diameter) of these channels and local hydraulic resistances. Well, and of course, one or another combustion model is used, describing the law of heat release in the cylinder after evaporation and ignition of the fuel.",

This part of the model is currently based on the ‘liquid’ piston flow model, but we have provided for the possibility of switching to a 1-dimensional gas flow model in the future, after the program is fully debugged, as is done in the known models of internal combustion engines.",

At least, with the correct mathematical description, the piston analogy allows you to get the same phase delay in air supply compared to the change in pressure in the combustion chamber, like any other method, including the most complex 3-D models. As a result, we managed to create a universal model of both a valved and valveless pulsejet engine, combining these models in one program for the first time.",

            "text18":"In reality, heat release does not occur simultaneously with the air intake. On the contrary, at each moment of intake time, only a small portion of air enters the combustion chamber, which is then mixed with the fuel, heated, the fuel evaporates, and only after that this portion of the fuel-air mixture ignites. That is why our model establishes a phase shift in the heat release rate relative to the instantaneous mass flow rate of air. This phase shift is the ignition delay time, which is calculated depending on the pressure and temperature according to the Arrhenius law. However, in relation to our problem, an attempt to directly calculate the ignition delay time gives not quite realistic results, causing instability of the calculation, which is why we switched to relative parameters, but maintaining the general nature of the dependence of time on pressure and temperature. As a result, we obtained the following formula:",
            "text19":"В даний час, коли ще не закінчена робота з доведення моделі, теплові втрати в стінки при вирішенні рівнянь температури і тиску тимчасово не враховуються. Натомість ми поки що просто зменшуємо величину η0, приймаючи її рівною не η0 = 0,95-0,98, а η0 = 0,70-0,75. Тим не менш, температура стінок у моделі вважається окремо за відповідними рівняннями теплового балансу з урахуванням теплоємності стінок. Так зроблено у зв'язку з виявленими проблемами збіжності розв'язання системи диференціальних рівнянь при спробі включити в ці рівняння тепловий потік у стінки (проте ми працюємо над тим, щоб знайти та усунути причину такої нестійкості).",

Таке припущення застосовно для порівняно коротких труб і зводить модель до так званої поршневої аналогії течії газу, тобто, до моделі ‘рідинного’ або ‘газового’ поршня. Тоді рух газу трубою розглядається як рух стовпа газу деякої маси, яка має властивості інерції. Це означає, що під дією змінного за часом перепаду тиску швидкість руху газу відставатиме від тиску – приблизно так само, як і під час руху хвиль у трубі.  ",

From a quantitative point of view, there is a comparison in our articles cited in the ‘Library’, from which it follows that the discrepancy between the ‘liquid’ piston model and the one-dimensional model in a fairly wide range of process frequencies is also small. All this allowed us to use this model when writing a program for simulating the working cycle of a pulsejet engine (however, we are already thinking about how to replace this model with a one-dimensional one in the future).",

This is a model that is the simplest and assumes that the frequency of natural oscillations of the petal is many times greater than the frequency of forced oscillations corresponding to the frequency of the engine process. That is, this model does not take into account dynamic phenomena during petal movement. Despite the fact that most scientists are sure that the quasi-stationary model is very bad and wrong, we have previously conducted our own research and compared it with the dynamic one (the corresponding article can be read in our ‘Library’). The results were amazing – for the total cyclic air flow rate, and this is the main parameter determining the accuracy of our entire engine model as a whole, the coincidence of the results is no worse than 10-15%.",

                        The calculation of the main parameters is carried out at the very beginning of the intake:
                              <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	in a valve engine – when the pressure difference in the chamber changes from positive (above atmospheric) to negative, since the pressure difference determines the intake,
                              <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	in a valveless engine – when air begins to enter the chamber (the coordinate of the air-gas boundary in the intake pipe becomes less than zero).

                              The logic of the algorithm determines these moments with high accuracy, and the first thing that is required is to determine the cycle time tc as the time of the start of the intake from a similar previous moment in time. This is a fundamentally important feature of the model - the cycle is not specified in any way, but is determined by the processes that occur in it and are described by the corresponding equations.
